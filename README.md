# BONELAB Fusion Pre Alpha
A multiplayer mod for BONELAB featuring support for Oculus and SteamVR.
This is currently only for PCVR platforms.
## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Steam, but the networking system can be swapped out using a Networking Layer.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to addon and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.

## Marrow SDK Integration
You can download the integration unity package from the Releases tab of this repository.
