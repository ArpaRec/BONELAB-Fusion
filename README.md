# BONELAB Fusion Pre Alpha
A multiplayer mod for BONELAB featuring support for Oculus and SteamVR as well as prepared Meta Quest 2 support.
Meta Quest 2 support will be fully implemented once Melonloader (or a sufficient code mod loader) works for standalone.

## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Photon Fusion. Reasons I switched from Discord:
- No mobile support
- Constant 1 second latency
- Lack of useful metworking Features
- Seemingly random breakdowns of their servers

## Disclaimer

#### THIS PROJECT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY OTHER MULTIPLAYER MODS OR STRESS LEVEL ZERO! This is its own standalone mod and shares no code with others, any similarities are coincidental!
